I am a Master's Student at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Florian Kerschbaum](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~fkerschb), working in the [Cryptography Security and Privacy (CrySP) Lab](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca). My current interests include differential privacy and the security and privacy of machine learning.
